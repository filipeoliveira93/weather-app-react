The Weather Forecast App is a web application that allows users to search for weather forecasts. It utilizes various technologies and APIs to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information. Here are the key features of the application:

- Geolocation with Google API: The app uses the Google API to fetch the user's geolocation, ensuring that the weather forecast is tailored to their current location.

- Weather Data with Open-Meteo API: It connects to the Open-Meteo API to retrieve weather data, including the current day's forecast and forecasts for the next 7 days.

- Temperature Chart with ApexCharts: The application displays a temperature chart for the next 36 hours, giving users a visual representation of temperature trends.

- Built with React, Vite, Axios, and Tailwind CSS: The entire application is developed using React, Vite for a fast development environment, Axios for making HTTP requests, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and stylish user interfaces.
